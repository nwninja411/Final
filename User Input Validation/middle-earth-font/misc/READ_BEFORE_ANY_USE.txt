-----------------------

Middle Earth is a Medieval calligraphy serif font. 
With the historic charm of ancient manuscripts and the ethereal beauty of elven realms, Middle Earth typeface weaves tales of valor and legends. 
Its calligraphic allure is accentuated by rounded contours, reminiscent of Tolkien's enchanted worlds. 
The unusually large lowercase, almost circular in its form, seems to echo the undulating hills of the Shire, while its Irish-inspired design lends a timeless elegance. 
Despite its delicate appearance, the typeface stands strong across all its weightsâ€”from the gossamer touch of 'Thin' to the commanding presence of 'Black.' Every character seems infused with a narrative, waiting to adorn pages with tales of yore.

Use parentheses characters ( ) { } [ ] to make symbols such as wolves, eagles or lions. 

This family consists of a very wide range of weights: Thin, Light, Regular, Bold and Black
Each weight is also delivered in Italic, resulting in ten unique styles. 

Also includes a variable font! 
Only one font file, but the file contains multiple styles. 
Use the sliders in Illustrator, Photoshop or InDesign to manually set any weight and slant. 
This gives you not only the 16 predefined styles, but instead more than a thousand ways to customize the type to the exact look your project requires.
